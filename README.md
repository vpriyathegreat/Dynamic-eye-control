# Dynamic-eye-control
Eye-Controlled Mouse Project: Utilizes OpenCV for webcam video capture, MediaPipe for real-time facial landmark detection (specifically eye movements), and PyAutoGUI for automating mouse control based on detected eye positions. Demonstrates innovative human-computer interaction by enabling mouse cursor control through eye movements.
